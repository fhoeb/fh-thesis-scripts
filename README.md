## Scripts to reproduce the results from the master thesis Tensor Network based simulation of Open Quantum Systems by Fabian HÃ¶b


Required packages:

* numpy, scipy, matplotlib, py-orthpol, mpnum, py-tmps, py-mapping

Supported Python versions:

* 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

### Note
These are not the original scripts used to produce the data and figures for the thesis,
but these use the same libraries and similar code structure. The scripts in this library are merely intended
to provide a simple way of reproducing the same results or to further probe the parameter space if desired.
